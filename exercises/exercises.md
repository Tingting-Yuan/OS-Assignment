# Operating Systems examples and exercises in C

## Exercises

1. Write a C program that swaps the two integer values passed as parameters (Hint: both parameters have to be passed by reference).
   note: “Pass by reference” means passing the address of a variable instead of directly switching its value.

3. Modify the program ``posix/pthreads_example.c`` to accept the number of threads to create as a command line parameter.
